# Cordova W3C Web Crypto API

This is a Cordova plugin for ios that implements some of the W3C Web Crypto API functionality.

## Getting Started

The repo contains two sub folders, 

```
w3c-crypto-api
w3c-crypto-api-tests
```

with the former being a complete Cordova project to test the plugin. All development of the plugin should be done in the project as well, as I didn't find any convenient way to open the plugin files in XCode otherwise.

To install the plugin, clone the repo and open a terminal in your Cordova project. Then `cordova plugin add "/path/to/this/repo/w3c-crypto-api"`.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Cordova project with an iOS platform. If you want to test this plugin, open the existing Cordova Test Project: `w3c-crypto-api-tests`.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, simply type `npm run all-tests` in the main folder.

### SwiftLint

Linting exists, run it by typing 

```
npm run lint
```

You can manually run the different linters by typing

```
npm run swiftlint
npm run jslint
```

SwiftLint also supports autocorrect:

```
swiftlint autocorrect
```

### Unit Tests

I didn't find any way to Unit Test a cordova plugin yet. I am working on this.

### Manual Tests

You can manually test the plugin by running the test application. If it does not crash, all tests run successfully (Only method yet).
Run the test application with:

```
cd w3c-crypto-api-tests
npm run emu-test
```
